# lokesh-docker-basic-linux

This repository contains a small Docker example that demonstrates basic Linux commands inside a container.

## Files
- `Dockerfile` — builds an Alpine-based image with a small bash script.
- `commands.sh` — script that runs basic Linux commands when the container starts.
- `README.md` — this file.
- `git_push_instructions.txt` — step-by-step Git & Docker commands you can run from Windows (no native Linux required).

## 1. Five DevOps Concepts

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
Developers frequently merge code to a shared repository. Automated builds and tests verify changes quickly.

### 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
Automating releases so changes that pass tests can be deployed to production with minimal manual work.

### 3. Containerization
Packaging applications with their dependencies into containers (Docker) ensures consistent runtime environments.

### 4. Source Control (Git)
Version control system to track changes, collaborate, and manage branches and pull requests.

### 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Managing infrastructure (servers, networks) using code (Terraform, Ansible), enabling reproducibility and automation.
